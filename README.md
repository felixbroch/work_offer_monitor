## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key with web search access
- Internet connection for API calls

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FelixBROCHIER/job-search-assistant.git
   cd job-search-assistant
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**

   ```
   
   This will:
   - Check Python version compatibility
   - Install required dependencies
   - Set up environment configuration
   - Create necessary directories
   - Configure default companies to monitor

3. **Configure API credentials**
   
   The setup script will prompt you for your OpenAI API key, or you can manually edit `config/.env`:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

4. **Configure target companies**
   
   Edit `data/companies_to_watch.csv` to include your target companies:
   ```csv
   company_name,career_page_url
   ```

5. **Customise search criteria**
   
   Edit `config/config.py` to match your preferences:
   ```python
   FILTERING_CRITERIA = {
       "locations": ["London", "Remote", "Paris", "Europe"],
       "title_keywords": ["data scientist", "AI engineer", "analyst"],
       "experience_levels": ["graduate", "junior", "entry-level"]
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Manual Job Search
Run a one-time job search:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Automated Monitoring
Start daily automated monitoring:
```bash
# Start continuous scheduler (runs daily at 9 AM)
python main.py

# Run once for testing
python main.py --run-once
```

### Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard:
```bash
# Start development servers
python start_dev.py

# Or start manually
npm run dev  # Frontend
python backend/api/server.py  # Backend
```

The web interface provides:
- Interactive job listings with filtering
- Visual analytics and trend charts
- Company performance metrics
- CSV export functionality

## File Locations

After setup, your files will be organized as follows:

### Data Files
- `data/companies_to_watch.csv` - Target companies list
- `data/job_results.db` - SQLite database with job history
- `data/notifications_log.csv` - Notification history

### Configuration
- `config/config.py` - Application settings
- `config/.env` - Your API keys and environment variables

### Logs and Reports
- `logs/job_monitor.log` - Application execution logs
- `logs/job_results.md` - Latest search results
- `logs/daily_report_*.md` - Daily status reports

## How It Works

### Search Process
1. **Company Loading**: Reads target companies from CSV file
2. **Query Generation**: Creates search queries based on filtering criteria
3. **Web Search**: Uses OpenAI API to find current job postings
4. **Content Extraction**: Parses job titles, locations, requirements, and URLs
5. **Result Formatting**: Structures data for storage and analysis

### Tracking Process
1. **Job Discovery**: New jobs are marked as "new"
2. **Change Detection**: Modified jobs are marked as "modified"
3. **Status Updates**: Existing jobs are marked as "seen"
4. **Removal Tracking**: Missing jobs are marked as "removed"
5. **History Logging**: All changes are recorded with timestamps

### Dashboard Features
1. **Data Loading**: Connects to SQLite database for real-time data
2. **Interactive Filters**: Filter by company, status, location, and date range
3. **Visual Analytics**: Charts showing trends and distributions
4. **Job Details**: Expandable job listings with full information
5. **Export Options**: CSV download for external analysis

## Customisation

### Adapting for Different Roles
- Modify `FILTERING_CRITERIA` in `config.py` for your target roles
- Update company list in `companies_to_watch.csv`
- Adjust search queries in `job_watch_web_search.py` if needed

### Adding New Features
- **Email Notifications**: Add SMTP configuration for job alerts
- **Advanced Filtering**: Extend criteria for salary, company size, etc.
- **Application Tracking**: Add fields for application status
- **Integration**: Connect with LinkedIn, job boards, or ATS systems

### Performance Tuning

- Modify cleanup schedules in `scheduler.py`
- Configure database indexes for large datasets

## Notes and Considerations

### API Usage
- Requires OpenAI API key with web search capabilities
- API calls are rate-limited and may incur costs
- Respectful delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers

### Data Privacy
- All data is stored locally in SQLite database
- No personal information is transmitted to external services
- API keys are stored locally in environment variables

### Limitations
- Depends on OpenAI API availability and accuracy
- Search results may vary based on API performance
- Some job postings may not be detected due to site structure
