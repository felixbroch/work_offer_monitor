# ü§ñ OpenAI Agent-Based Job Search System

## Overview

The new job search system uses **OpenAI's native web search tools and agent system** instead of manual web scraping. This provides much more reliable and effective job discovery.

## üÜï What's New

### ‚úÖ **Replaced Manual Web Scraping**
- **Before**: Used BeautifulSoup and requests to manually scrape websites
- **After**: Uses OpenAI's built-in web search tool for real-time job discovery

### ‚úÖ **Added Intelligent Agent System** 
- **OpenAI Assistant**: Created a specialized job search assistant with web search capabilities
- **Smart Analysis**: Agent can analyze job postings and make relevance decisions
- **Structured Output**: Returns properly formatted job data with relevance scores

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Accuracy**
- **Real Web Search**: Actually searches company career pages in real-time
- **Context-Aware**: Understands job requirements and candidate criteria
- **Better Filtering**: More accurate relevance scoring (0-100 scale)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **OpenAIJobSearchAgent**
   - Uses OpenAI's web search tool directly
   - Makes single API calls with structured prompts
   - Fast and efficient for simple searches

2. **OpenAIJobSearchAssistant** 
   - Creates persistent OpenAI Assistant with web search capabilities
   - Better for complex, multi-step searches
   - Maintains context across searches

3. **Integration Layer**
   - `search_jobs_with_openai_agent()` - Main integration function
   - Fallback system: Assistant ‚Üí Direct Agent
   - Backward compatible with existing code

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Web Search Process**
```
User Request ‚Üí OpenAI Agent ‚Üí Web Search Tool ‚Üí Company Career Pages ‚Üí Job Analysis ‚Üí Structured Results
```

### 2. **Agent Decision Making**
- **Step 1**: Agent searches company's official career page
- **Step 2**: Finds current job postings matching criteria
- **Step 3**: Analyzes each job for relevance (location, keywords, experience level)
- **Step 4**: Scores relevance (0-100) and provides reasoning
- **Step 5**: Returns only highly relevant jobs (score ‚â• 70)

### 3. **Data Structure**
```json
{
  "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "url": "https://company.com/jobs/12345",
  "company_name": "Tech Corp",
  "relevance_score": 85,
  "reasoning": "Perfect match: senior level, SF location, software engineering role",
  "experience_level": "senior",
  "key_skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
  "found_date": "2025-01-22T10:30:00",
  "is_relevant": true
}
```
