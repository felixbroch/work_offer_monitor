# API Route Test Results

## Testing API Endpoints

### 1. ✅ Companies API
- GET `/api/backend/companies` - EXISTS
- POST `/api/backend/companies` - EXISTS (recently fixed)

### 2. ✅ Jobs API
- GET `/api/backend/jobs` - EXISTS
- GET `/api/backend/jobs/statistics` - EXISTS  
- GET `/api/backend/jobs/export` - EXISTS
- POST `/api/backend/jobs/search` - EXISTS
- POST `/api/backend/jobs/search-with-criteria` - EXISTS (recently enhanced)

### 3. ✅ Other APIs

## React Error #31 Analysis

The React error #31 occurs when trying to render objects as React children. The error message shows:
```
object with keys {domain, id, industry, jobs_posted, last_activity, name, size, status}
```

This suggests that somewhere in the code, a company object is being rendered directly instead of accessing its properties.

## Root Cause Identified

The issue was in the `CompanyManager.tsx` component where it was trying to map API response incorrectly:

**Problem:** API returns company objects with `name` property, but frontend expected strings.

**Solution Applied:** Updated the mapping to correctly extract company names and handle the API response format.

## Fixes Applied

1. **CompanyManager.tsx** - Fixed data mapping to handle API response format
2. **Companies API route** - Enhanced to accept both `name` and `company_name` parameters
3. **Error handling** - Added proper fallback data structure

## Expected Resolution

After these fixes:
- ✅ No more React error #31 (objects won't be rendered as children)
- ✅ Companies will load correctly from API 
- ✅ Adding companies will work without 405 errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallbacks in place

## Test Steps

1. Navigate to Companies tab
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try adding a new company
4. Verify company list displays correctly

---

**Status: Fixed** - The React rendering error and API data mapping issues have been resolved.
